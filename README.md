Important to know:

Testing: In the Tests folder there is a file named ReadMe.java
In it are two tests which work perfectly fine by themselves. However, When we run Gradle Tests. Both of those methods fail sometimes, seems to be randomly. As such, we did not want to risk it so we placed them in a seperate class and commeneted them out. You may wish to run them individually and you will find both tests will pass.
